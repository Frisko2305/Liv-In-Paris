In the context of our engeneering studies, we were tasked with the project of developping a meal-sharing service between people in Paris.
We use mainly C# coding for front-end developping (client and chefs users for ordering meals among a list of choices and managing orders according to the distance with the customer),
and SQL for back-end coding, learning how to setup and exploit a database and using it in the context of this project.
